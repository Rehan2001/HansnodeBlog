SSH is a software package that enables secure system administration and file transfers over insecure networks.

It was developed by [**Tatu Ylonen**](https://ylonen.org/) in 1995 in response to a hacking incident in the **Finnish University Network**.

### Secure Shell Key

It allows users to connect with the server, without having to remember or enter passwords for each system. It always comes in key pairs:

* Public key - Everyone can see it, no need to protect it.
    
* Private Key - Stays in computer, must be protected.
    

Key pairs can following types:

* Client key - If Public and Private key remain with user.
    
* Server Key - If Public and Private key remain with remote system.
    
* Sessions key - Used when a large amount of data is to be transmitted.
    

**The general procedure is:**

* Public keys from the local computers (system) are passed to the server which is to be accessed.
    
* The server then identifies if the public key is registered.
    
* If so, the server then creates a new secret key ( Session Key) with encrypted code and encrypts it with the public key which was sent by client via local computer.
    
* This encrypted code is sent to the local computer.
    
* This data is unlocked by the private key of the system and is sent to the server.
    
* The server after receiving this data verifies the local computer.
    
* SSH creates a route and all the encrypted data are transferred through it with no security issues.
    

### Cryptography Techniques Used In SSH

1. Symmetric Cryptography: Single key used for encrypting and decrypting the message. e.x DES ans AES.

2. Asymmetric Cryptography: 2 key used for encrypting and decrypting the message. e.x RSA, Digital Signature

3. Hashing: This converts a variable-length string to a fixed-length string. This fixed-length value is called a hash value, which is generated by a hash function.

## [OpenSSH](https://www.openssh.com/)

**OpenSSH** is an open-source implementation of the **SSH protocol**. OpenSSH consist of following tools:

* ***Openssh-Clients:*** The OpenSSH client program is called [***ssh***](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/command). [Th](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/command)e SSH client generally uses information in the *.ssh* directory in the user's home directory. It also reads [**/etc/ssh/ssh\_config**](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/config),
    
    * [Remote operatio](https://www.ssh.com/ssh/config)ns are done by client using [ssh](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh.1), [scp](https://man.openbsd.org/scp.1), and [sftp](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp.1).
        
    * Key management with [ssh-add](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1), [ssh-keysign](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keysign.8), [ssh-keyscan](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keyscan.1), and [ssh-keygen](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-keygen.1).
        
* ***Openssh-Server:*** The OpenSSH server program is called *sshd.* The server is typically started during boot, and reads its configuration from /etc/ssh directory. Its main configuration file is usually /etc/ssh/sshd\_config.
    
    * The service side consists of [sshd](https://man.openbsd.org/sshd.8), [sftp-server](https://man.openbsd.org/sftp-server.8), and [ssh-agent](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-agent.1).
        

## Installation of OpenSSH

SSH used port number 22 at TCP/IP.

Step 1: Installing of OpenSSH software on both Client and Server.

For Debian/Ubuntu-based Systems, open the terminal and run:

```bash
sudo apt install openssh-client openssh-server
```

For Red Hat-based systems like CentOS or Fedora, use either of the following commands:

```bash
sudo dnf install openssh-clients openssh-server
```

Step 2: Verify the OpenSSH Installation.

```bash
ssh -V
```

other way to verify is to look at relevant configuration files

Client Configuration file

```bash
$ file /etc/ssh/ssh_config
```

Remote Server Configuration file

```bash
$ file /etc/ssh/sshd_config                                                  
```

## How to SSH to remote server

### Connect using Username and password:

Syntax of SSH command in Linux.

```bash
$ ssh [username]@[hostname or IP address]
```

1. Username:
    
    ```bash
    $ whoami 
    ```
    
2. Ip Address:
    
    ```bash
    $ ip addr show
    ```
    

### Connect Using Key:

**Step 1:** Public and Private [key generation](https://www.ssh.com/academy/ssh/keygen)

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t [algo-used] -b [key-size-in-bits] -f [file location to saved key]
```

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f ~/.ssh/rehan -b 521
```

Algorithm: rsa, dsa, ecdsa, ed25519

After running this command, youâ€™re left with private ssh key called rehan and public ssh key called rehan.pub

**Private key: /home/user/.ssh/rehan**

**Public key: /home/user/.ssh/rehan.pub**

Changed permission of private key so that only owner can read and write

```bash
$ cd /home/user/.ssh
```

```bash
$ chmod 600 rehan
```

**Step 2:** Copy the ssh key to remote server, to do so you must be able to login remote server with its password.

```bash
$ ssh-copy-id -i [public-key-file-locaton] user@RemoteIP
```

```bash
$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/user/.ssh/rehan.pub RemoteRehan@192.171.10.2
```

Step 3: Login to remoter server.

```bash
$ ssh usrername@RemoteIP
```

to verify run the below command after login, you will see the remoter server username.

```bash
$whoami
```
