Hey, Aspiring DevOps EngineerðŸ˜€!

Look at how software is built, delivered and maintained in this rapidly evolving software Technology.

At starting I also had a lot of confusion too, but only thing you need is consistencyðŸ’ªðŸ’¯.

I am here to guide you even if you have no prior knowledge.

DevOps is a journey from building software to the end of deploying and maintaining a forever software development life cycle.

## What is DevOps?

DevOps is a combination of 2 words, "Development" and "Operation". It is a team approach to build the software and deliver at a fast rate to Customers' needs. In simple terms, DevOps is an alignment between development and IT operations with better communication and collaboration.

It allows the organization to deliver a high-quality solution for a product, It automates all processes, from build to deployment, of an application.

## Importance of DevOps

Problems Faced by Traditional IT SDLC

1. Separate development & operations teams created communication barriers, slow feedback loops, and challenges with deployment and maintenance.
    
2. Manual and inconsistent deployment processes, no automation.
    
3. Take a long time for software development and deployment.
    
4. Security vulnerabilities due to delayed updates.
    

How DevOps solved these challenges

1. DevOps encourages collaboration between the dev and Ops teams.
    
2. It promotes automation of the deployment process & less manual work each time of code deployment.
    
3. Due to automated software deployment, it takes less time for the application delivered.
    
4. DevOps integrates security practices early in the development process, automating security testing and compliance checks to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities proactively.
    

### DevOps Life Cycle

1. Plan - Define objectives, requirements, and release schedules for development
    
    cycle.
    
    Tools: JIRA(recommended), Slack, MURAL, miro
    
2. Code - Write and review code collaboratively to ensure functionality and maintainability.
    
    Tools: Git, Jenkins other open source CI/CD Tools
    
3. Build - After programmers have completed their tasks, they use tools such as Maven and Gradle to submit the code to the common code source.
    
    Tools: Apache Maven, Gradle, Apache Ant
    
4. Test - Validate code changes through automated and manual testing to ensure quality and reliability.
    
    Tools: JUnit, Cucumber, Selenium, Apache JMeter
    
5. Release - Deploy applications or updates into production environments securely and efficiently.
    
    Tools: same as deploy phase
    
6. Deploy - Implement changes to live environments while monitoring for issues and performance.
    
    Tools: Kubernetes, Nomad, Jenkins, Ansible, Terraform
    
7. Operate - Manage and maintain deployed applications, addressing issues and optimizing performance.
    
    Tools: Jira Services, Jira Software, Opsgenie, Statuspage
    
8. Monitor - Continuously collect and analyze metrics to evaluate application to performance and user experience.
    
    Tools: Grafana, Prometheus, Nagios
    

## 7 C of DevOps Phase

### Continuous Planning

Continuous planning in DevOps starts small, tests business value, learns from customers, adapts quickly, and updates plans accordingly.

### **Collaborative development (CD)**

In Continuous Development code is written in small, continuous bits rather than all at once, this improves efficiency every time a piece of code is created, it is tested, built, and deployed into production.

### Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration (CI) is a key part of the DevOps lifecycle focused on automating the process of integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository

### **Continuous testing**

Continuous testing reduces the testing cost while helping the development teams balance speed and quality. we can perform continuous testing using automation testing tools such as **Testsigma, Selenium, LambdaTest,** etc.

### **Continuous release and deployment**

Continuous Deployment: Continuous Deployment or Continuos Delivery **is the process** of automatically deploying an application into the production environment when it has completed testing and the build stages.

### **Continuous monitoring**

We can continuously monitor and can get notified before anything goes wrong with the help of Prometheus we can gather many performance measures, including CPU and memory utilization, network traffic, application response times, error rates, and others.

### **Continuous feedback and optimization**

Once the application is released to market the end user gives us feedback on the software application and this helps us to improve the software quality.

## **In conclusion**

DevOps is an increasingly popular methodology that aims to connect developers and operators into a collaborative unit. It's uniquely differentiated from traditional IT operations and complements.
